On the consistency of the SIFT Method
================================================================================

Object recognition or image matching algorithms are based on the extraction of
local descriptors on some interest points. The descriptors have to be
invariant to viewpoints changes (rotation, translation and scale of the
patch studied), illumination, noise etc.

One popular method to extract those features is the Scale Invariant Feature
Transform (SIFT) algorithm, which is invariant to illumination, rotation and
scale. [1]_ studies the consistency of the SIFT method to scale invariance.
